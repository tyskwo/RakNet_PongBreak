## Combining elements of Pong and Breakout. 
The goal scoring of Pong with the brick breaking of Breakout. 
Use the grid to better estimate where the ball is going to be!




### Controls: 
UP and DOWN arrow keys to move your paddle up and down. Player two hits space to start the game.


### Unique Features:
We have dead reckoning for both the paddles and the ball, allowing the game to be buttery smooth, even at 5 fps! We have a moving grid-based background, which gives a better sense of ball movement and better immerses the players. We also have rugged collision detection, allowing the ball to bounce between the bricks! All of this combined with the ever-increasing speed of the ball makes this a little more than the Pong you played as a kid.
